Jacek:
following sequence applies:
bots -> your orders -> bots -> cleanup
Whatever orders match to trades updates  your profit
Exchange will close positions at the end of simulation using price you can't access. It will be close to mid_price listed in CSV file
mid price is just mean of best bid and best ask at the moment right?

How is the profit_and_loss column calculated? are these the realized profits/loss after closing the position?
Jacek — Today at 9:48 AM
Not really
When trade is done you have some position (when you buy) or cash (when you sell) based on that 
Position item is evaluated using hidden price with value close to mid_price, cash remains unchanged 
Note there is a single line for each product inside the log
If you make no trade PnL will be zero anyway

Position item is evaluated using hidden price with value close to mid_price, cash remains unchanged 
can you explain this statement using an example?

you buy single AMETHYSTS for 9999 seashells and leave it as-is for 2 000 loops
it means you have cash of -9999 and single AMETHYSTS
Value of the AMETHYSTS changes over time and will reach 10 001 at the end
this means your profit will be 10 001 - 9999 = 2 for AMETHYSTS product
If you will manage to sell it on 10 002 then no AMETHYSTS is left in you positions and cash will be 10 002 - 9999 = 3
Idea of HFT is kind of similar
Similar for sell
